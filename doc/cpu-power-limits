Intel processors have power limits, which set the amount of power the CPU
can draw, which in turn affect clock speeds and performance. These limits
are typically set in the BIOS, but we can also set them as linux system
parameters (sysfs). The two main power limits are:
   * PL1: long duration power limit, often set to the processor's TDP,
          and is the maximum sustained power the CPU can draw.
   * PL2: short duration power limit, usually higher than PL1, allowing
          the CPU to briefly draw more power for performance bursts.

The above limits can be set in the following files, which are part of the
RAPL (Intel Running Average Power Limit), part of the Power Cap Framework:
   * /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0/constraint_0_power_limit_uw, to set PL1
   * /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0/constraint_1_power_limit_uw, to set PL2
   * /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0/enabled, to enable RAPL

The above files are temporary (sysfs kernel interface) and must be written on
every boot. To to that we use the systemd-tmpfiles service, which can be used
to create of modify temporary files at boot. We configure systemd-tmpfiles by
creating a file in /etc/tmpfiles.d. For example, for PL1=120W and PL2=210W,
we create a file called energy_performance_preference.conf with the following:

w /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0/constraint_0_power_limit_uw - - - - 120000000
w /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0/constraint_1_power_limit_uw - - - - 210000000
w /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0/enabled - - - - 1
